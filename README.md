# contact-tracing-exposure-notification
This will be used in the effort to track and contain known Covid 19 infections and also alert to emerging hot spots in real time also your device will send alerts if you are going to be in close contact with a person who has been exposed.You will be notified and reminded to wear extra protection before you even expose yourself to the unseen threat.Also this application will be used to make covid 19 visible by the collection of data we can contain and starve off the virus while also giving ourselves extra protection..Make an unseen enemy seen                                              "stupid thoughts and inventions"  

1.Heated toilet seat wirelessly controlled  by your phone or laptop.>>"Hate sitting on a cold seat well make the call and get a hot seat for only 4 easy payments of $19.95 lol jk it also comes with a pre installed app to tell you jokes while sitting. haha... Now for the serious part that joke was just to open your mind a little and prepare you for the things that will soon become your reality.



                                                    "Counter Measure To 'Covid19'"
                                                      
    This is an application to track verified and documented coronavirus"Covid19" infections and all contacts of ill persons so as to send allerts and updates and also notify you who not to come in contact with, it also tracks known hotspots or immerging hotspots by using technology we already have in place such as gps and location logging systems..Utilizing IEEE 802.11 protocols as the standard for authentication specifically the 2.4/5 ghz frequencies and one of 14 channels will be selected by the program to avoid any interference..so it lets you know where not to go via alerts....and Over a short period the virus will be mapped out and contained by my program and only key "Hotspots" areas will feel the affects of the Pandemic..The only way for this to work 100% is to issue out mandatory cell devices to those in need of a device and require by law during the pandemic to have said app installed on wireless device or cell phone and it's also a requirement by law to keep said device activated as long as this epidemic/pandemic is still in affect."Data and cell service will be provided for low income families and disabled persons".And also as parents and guardians of your children it is your sole resposibility to ensure that they ineteract with app and keep the device supporting the app fully functional "charged" at all times as this app Is also a new requirement of each individual when you enter any government office or public shopping center Fuel station or even private organizations.With the logging info we can cut off the virus b4 it has a chance to spread...Data spreads and transfers faster than any virus."Be Proactive not reactive." This could be combined with the processing power of Facebook app and would imensely reduce the development time to mer weeks.Utilizing their friend suggestion feature to also log possible contacts who were possibly exposed to the virus,,Everything is already in place it just has to be programmed to work for this cause.Government participation to pass these temporary laws to have said app is imminent to the survival of the human race.With this logging app and listener it also checks o2 levels and body temp it listens for signs of the virus such as sneezing,coughing,& chills recognized by chattering teeth sound...all silently logged while user is using the cell device in this manner it causes no stress and cortisol levels will not be affected actually helping the fight against the disease go in our favor.The less the people know about this invisible warfare the better because the stress and anxiety will cause levels to rise and peoples immunities will weaken if this is not handled right.
    2 twice a day you have to do a health assesment to keep data up to date and aid in realtime tracking "possibly more checkups per day during outbreaks" 
3.assesment takes mer minutes even seconds depending on user and their data input "program will have  a user friendly interface so non tech people will have no problem....this has to be made simple as it will be part of everyones daily lives and routine and you dont have to enter any data by hand it uses voice recognicion to authenticate individual users...voice input is the only input required by most,, other methods are in development for the deaf and physically handicap as to not cause any more burdens on their lives...etc...  Notifications are sent by the app from the main infrastructure of intelliegence in an email,text and voicemail in all formats as to cover the broad spectrum of users needs to ensure acurate and immediate delivery of important notifications as these implimentations are in place to keep our economy and infrastructure strong and well protected to ensure the safety and well being of all the people ..
4.State of emergency laws can be passed to let the people know how serious this tracking app is and a speach needs to be done to let the people know how important their participation is in winning the fight against covid19 
3.this program will listen for the amount of times that you sneeze or cough and will require a checkup if too many signs are logged by the app "Do not let the Public know that the app is listening for their coughs or sneezes .....Some people who know about this may try to decept the app and further prolong the road to recovery....the only thing the people need to know about the internals and workings of the app are the "requirement by law to enter any facility public or private" It is also a requirement to keep your device charged and if too many contact attempts are made by the app to contact the user and three failed contact attemps are logged you will be blacklisted until cleared by a public health official authorized to enforce the policies of the app you will lose all authorizatioin to enter any building or public place and also your bank accounts can be disabled if the person is infected and intentionally going awol as to decept the program,failure to comply with these state of emergency proticals could result in your banishment from society and placement into an isolation cell "quarantine"for an indetermenent amount of time considering all the factors of said individual.
the app will use a voice recognition app to authenticate the user such as asking the user "hello can you hear me?" "how are you feeling?",,"Stay strong and know that we are in this together"...Every day is closer to victory...user input will have to be spoken so the app can authenticate that the user is near by and in possesion of tracking device and no input from the user for a certain period of time will trigger an alert to local health officials and an assesment made from the data .....Voice recognition software authenticates the assesment..this application will create a lot of new oportunities and also help in the transition of a fully connected data infrastructure...Do you think that this Covid 19 is the last new virus or plague we will see??? Its just the beginning of the possible extinction of the human race.It is also a huge part of our National security as a defense against future attacks like this and a containment procedure for a biological warfare attack.
TO make this simple to understand and why we need this app a  presidential speech will be made notifying the people of the app and it's countermeasures to end the pandemic and also it must be implimented in place in case of future pandemics....plagues like the black death are still possible even today and people need to realize how important their participation is with this app and federal and local health officials..Participation during a pandemic will be required or you will not be permitted to buy gas or even enter a store
  this app will also create new employment opportunities and also help in the aid of preventing other illnesses from being spread to large groups in the future...social distancing is only so reliable as to the persons integrity...proticols will be imlplimented to detect deception and also log and require interaction every hr or the desired time that doesnt too much intrude on peoples lives but also doesnt leave enough time for data leaks if a person has went in public without their device."This is the main reason devices will need to be installed on all public placesyou scan your device upon entry" With everyones participation with the app or program we can cut off the spread of the virus and completely starve it off from new host and while we are doing this we will be saving thousands of lives and also putting a new implimentation in place that is critical to the infrastructure of our country and to the well being of the people and also a prevention and containment program in place in case of new pandemics or plagues,,,,and also to aid in fighting a biological warfare attack and a defense against an attack.
which quite possibly could be what this was...an attack..We live in uncertain times and,we need measures in place to act fast in case of future attacks like this...I've been warning people for years that the terrorist were attacking in stealthy ways they just havn't been too succesful ....reference to the zika virus and how it was also a terror attack and not one person put the pieces together and realized it..
  We as a people as a living working and growing society need this application in place to be used during "States of Emergency" And "Pandemics" to save human lives and reduce the number of casualties and the amount of economic impact on the infrastructure like in ref to b4 the app we would have to social isolate a whole workforce of people who are essential to the production of food and also the transport and delivery of goods along with food...we have to have this in place or we could possibly be thrown into  Recession or possibly another depression like the bread lines of the 20s but this time they dont even serve bread because you have to be away from people.....we hAVE TO MAKE THE  people realize how important this is and how their participation will affect the future of our kids and how this could end a possible mass extinction..these things are getting stronger and the dr's over the years have prescribed too many antibiotics for just about any illness in which case this causes you to build an immunity to the drugs and also these other illnesess are building an imunnity also and becoming resistent to antibiotics.over presribing has caused this "I know that viruses aren't affected by antibiotics im using this as a statement to make a point". and also the use of antibacterial hand soaps have played a key role in this factor also...What we need to make the people realize is that our world is evolving and everything is getting smarter on how to kill us so we need to be proactive and have implimentations in place as well as a strategic counter measure to combat an enemy such as this ghost covid19 every citizens full cooperation and support will be required as you have a responsibility as a citizen of the United States and the World as a whole for the people and future generations to come to ensure that our future generations have a chance to live in a world where sickness didnt destroy our race but made the people more innovative and wiser while also making us resilient and brave in the battle against unseen enemies with the help of this software and also the participation of all the good citizens of the Great country we live in we can make an unseen enemy a silent killer visible with the data this software provides and by decloaking this virus we can cut the virus off and stop the spread of this without crippling the entire infrastructure of our country while also providing new opportunities and employment for the people during this battle.
  Continued thoughts and possible new techniques to help in the tracking of "covid19/20"
  1.Possibly try to urge big tech companies like Samsung and Apple to start issuing new devices with thermal reading hardware in the latest devices."Some CAT devices have these installed by default to aid in contractors thermal immaging tasks.If the gov issued devices have these it can aid in detecting people with fever due to possible covid19 infection.Also like some of the Samsung Galaxy phones an O2 saturation detector should be implimented into these devices as well so that a person using the app can do a daily health assesment just like would be conducted by a triage nurse upon addmitence into an E.R. also these O2 readers can detect a persons heart rate which is also an important factor....Some people are walking around with covid19 and have extremely low O2 levels...This can aid in detection immensely...
